<h1 align="center"> UserVault FRONTEND: Login API </h1>

<p align="center">
I've developed a login website using Angular for the frontend and Java for the backend. The project provides a secure authentication experience for users, featuring custom login and signup pages. I leveraged services like Angular Router for page navigation and AuthGuard to protect specific routes from unauthorized access. The frontend showcases a responsive and intuitive layout, with login and signup forms validated using Angular Forms. On the backend, I implemented user authentication and validation logic, utilizing techniques like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization.
